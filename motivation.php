        Around 20 million animals are killed for testing drugs/formulations at pre-clinical drug trials.
            Despite this, more than 90% of the drugs fail to match the results in human trials causing loss of billions of dollars 
            and wasted sacrifice of animal lives.
    
            Here comes CellversePvt. Ltd., with a vision to revolutionize pre-clinical testing procedures by developing 
            non animal disease models for drugs/formulation testing.
    
    
            We design & develop invitro physiological and pathological models as an alternative platform for Preclinical
            Trials as required by the Pharmaceutical Industry and Biomedical Research Groups. We also develop bioink and 
            other auxiliary technology as per requirements.
    
            Cellverse is a Med tech Company working at the interface of tissue engineering, 3D Bioprinting, Artificial 
            Intelligence and Biomicrofluidics.
